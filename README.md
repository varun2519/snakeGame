# snakeGame
A classic Snake Game built in Java using Swing for the GUI and game mechanics. This project demonstrates core programming concepts, object-oriented design principles, and graphical user interface (GUI) development in Java.

Features:
Dynamic Gameplay:
The snake moves in a grid-based environment, controlled by the arrow keys.
Food is randomly generated, avoiding overlap with the snake's body.
Score Tracking:
Tracks and displays the player's score based on the number of food items consumed.
Collision Detection:
The game ends when the snake collides with itself or the boundaries of the panel.
Pause Functionality:
Players can pause and resume the game using the space bar.
Customizable Settings:
Adjustable game area and unit size for different resolutions.
Technical Highlights:
GUI Development:
Built using the Swing library, with responsive rendering for the snake, food, and score.
Event Handling:
Implements KeyListener for handling directional movement and pause functionality.
Randomized Food Placement:
Ensures food is generated at valid positions within the grid and avoids collisions with the snake's body.
Efficient Game Loop:
Uses a Timer for consistent game updates and smooth animations.
Learning Outcomes:
Mastered Java Swing for building desktop applications.
Gained experience in managing real-time game updates and event-driven programming.
Implemented core programming concepts like arrays, loops, and conditional logic.
Improved debugging skills, especially for collision detection and game logic.
